Create a fractal using Newton's Method on a complex-valued function.

To get started, clone this repository on your machine, create a virtual
environment with `python3 -m venv venv`, activate it with 
`source venv/bin/activate`, and install the required libraries with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
